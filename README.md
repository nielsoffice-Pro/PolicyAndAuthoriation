# Policy And Authorization
Laravel About Policy and Authorization


In Laravel, Authorization and Policy are both ways to manage access control and determine who can perform a given action on a resource. While they are related, they serve different purposes and are used in different ways. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and how they are used in Laravel:

1. Authorization
Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has permission to perform a given action. Laravel provides multiple ways to handle authorization, including gate-based and policy-based approaches.

Gates: Gates provide a simple way to authorize actions. Gates are typically used for actions that aren't associated with a specific model, like viewing a dashboard, accessing admin routes, or even custom actions.

Example of Gate: In AuthServiceProvider.php, you can define gates like this:

```PHP

Gate::define('edit-post', function ($user, $post) {
    return $user->id === $post->user_id;
});


```

To check authorization in your controllers or views:

```php

if (Gate::allows('edit-post', $post)) {
    // User can edit the post
}


```

Simple Gate Example:

```php

if (Gate::denies('edit-post', $post)) {
    abort(403);
}


```

When to use Gates:

When you need a simple, one-off authorization check.
When the logic for the action is not tied to a specific model.

2. Policies
Policies are a more structured and object-oriented approach for authorizing actions. Policies are typically tied to a model and define a set of authorization rules for that model (e.g., whether a user can view, update, delete, etc.).

Policy Classes: Laravel automatically creates a policy for a model when you generate one using the php artisan make:policy command.

Example: If you want to create a policy for a Post model, you can run:

```php

php artisan make:policy PostPolicy

```

Laravel will create a PostPolicy class in the app/Policies directory. In that policy class, you can define methods like view, update, delete, etc., to authorize different actions for the Post model.

```php

// app/Policies/PostPolicy.php
public function update(User $user, Post $post)
{
    return $user->id === $post->user_id;
}

```

Registering Policies: In the AuthServiceProvider.php, you need to register your policy:

```php

protected $policies = [
    Post::class => PostPolicy::class,
];


```


Using Policies: In your controller, you can check if the user is authorized using the authorize method:

```php

public function update(Post $post)
{
    $this->authorize('update', $post);  // This will automatically use the PostPolicy
}


```

Alternatively, in views, you can use the can directive:


```php

@can('update', $post)
    <!-- The current user can update the post -->
@endcan


```

When to use Policies:

When you have model-specific authorization logic (e.g., a user can only edit or delete their own posts).
For a more structured and reusable authorization mechanism.
For handling complex authorization logic tied to models.
Key Differences

Aspect	| Authorization (Gates)	| Policy
<br><b>Definition:</b> A simple way to authorize actions (via Gate).	| A structured way to authorize actions tied to a model (via Policy).

<br><b>Use Case:</b> Typically for generic or global actions (e.g., admin access).	| Typically for model-specific actions (e.g., edit a post).
<br><b>Registration:</b>	Registered in AuthServiceProvider.	| Registered in AuthServiceProvider.
<br><b>Check Method:</b>	``` Gate::allows() ``` or ``` Gate::denies() ```	| ``` authorize() ``` in controllers or ``` @can ``` in views.
<br><b>Structure:</b>	One-off authorization checks.	Defines multiple authorization rules for a given model.
<br><b>Use Case Example:</b>	"Can the user delete a comment?" |	"Can the user update a post?"


Conclusion:
Gates are ideal for quick, simple, and one-off authorization checks where actions are not tied to a specific model.
Policies are more structured and suited for handling authorization for specific actions tied to models. They are easier to maintain and extend when your application grows.
